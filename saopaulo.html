                              The cold days can feel surprisingly cool indoors, as many of the city’s buildings don’t have heating.</td>

                    <p class="aa-end">As Sao Paulo is located in the Southern Hemisphere, seasons are opposite of the Northern Hemisphere’s, meaning summer begins in December and stretches through February. Those wanting to avoid the rain should come during the driest (though still rainy) time of the year from April to September. However, for those planning on going to the nearby beaches, summer will be best, when temperatures are highest.</p>
